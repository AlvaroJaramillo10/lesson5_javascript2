### Project Description:
In my own words this assignment is about learning to make html5 and javascript work together as one on a website.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A lesson I learned is to consistently only cut or copy beginning and ending with the curly brackets if possible because I spent a long time with a parsing error to find out that essentialy I left a bracket out in a copy.
2. A concept I learned in this assignment is to properly pull information from and input in an html file into a javascript file and give the output to the html file.
3. A concept that I learned through this assignment is how one might go about reverse engineering an algorythm that has already been created.
